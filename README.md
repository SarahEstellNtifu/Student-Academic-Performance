# Student-Academic-Performance

This Power BI project investigates how tutoring and extracurricular support impact student outcomes in math and reading across U.S. districts and states. Using two datasets (`StudentData.csv` and `StudentTestingData.csv`), I developed an interactive dashboard to explore trends by district, grade, year, and subject area.

## Project Objectives:																	
- Measure the effect of tutoring on math and reading scores.																
- Identify grade-level performance patterns.																							
- Compare yearly academic performance trends.																				
- Present key insights in a fully interactive, user-driven dashboard.														

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- Power BI Desktop for data modeling and interactive dashboard creation.
- Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures.
- Charts & Visualizations: Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, and slicers.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Removed missing, duplicate, and irrelevant data entries.
- Standardized column names and formatted dates for consistency.
- Merged StudentData and StudentTestingData using unique identifiers (e.g., student ID or district).
- Created calculated columns for total tutoring hours and score averages.

## Key Interactive Features

Tutoring Impact Dashboard:															
- View average math and reading scores vs. tutor count per district.						
- Filter by district to view average tutor hours by city and state.												
- Assess state-level trends in tutoring hours and their academic impact.			

## Grade-Level Performance Trends:		
- Compare math and reading score trends from Grade 9 to 12.
- See performance breakdown by district and grade.
- State-level visual breakdown by grade category.

## Yearly Performance Comparison:
- Compare score changes from 2022–2023 to 2023–2024.
- Track improvements by state, district, and grade.

** All visuals are interactive - clicking on a slicer filters the entire dashboard to show relevant information based on the information needed.**

## Skills Gained:
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Data visualization 
- Data wrangling 
- DAX 
- Dashboard storytelling 
- Performance trend analysis
