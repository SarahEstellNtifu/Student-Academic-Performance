# Student-Academic-Performance

This Power BI project investigates how tutoring and extracurricular support impact student outcomes in math and reading across U.S. districts and states. Using two datasets (`StudentData.csv` and `StudentTestingData.csv`), I developed an interactive dashboard to explore trends by district, grade, year, and subject area.

## Key Features
- Interactive visualizations by district, grade, city, and year.
- Insight into tutoring hours vs. academic scores.
- Year-over-year performance comparisons.
- Clean and structured data pipeline using Power Query.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- DAX
- CSV data sources

## Objective
Help educators and administrators identify where tutoring is most effective to improve student learning outcomes.
